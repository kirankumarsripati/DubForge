# DubForge Architecture

Version: 1.0

Status: Draft

# 1. Architecture Goals

The architecture must satisfy:

- Offline first
- Replaceable AI providers
- No UI blocking
- Restartable jobs
- Testable
- Open Source friendly
- Apple Silicon optimized
- Future proof

# 3. Layers

Presentation Layer

- React
- shadcn/ui
- Zustand

Responsibilities

- UI only
- No business logic
- No ffmpeg
- No AI

---

Application Layer

Node

Responsibilities

- Queue
- IPC
- Cache
- Logging

No AI implementation.

---

Pipeline Layer

Responsibilities

- Execute processing stages
- Retry
- Resume
- Artifact management

---

Worker Layer

Python

Responsibilities

- Speech Recognition
- Translation
- Speech Generation

Nothing else.

---

# 7. Job Object

Job

errors

---

# 8. Artifact System

Every stage generates artifacts.

Example

audio.wav

transcript.json

english.srt

hindi.txt

hindi.wav

metadata.json

Nothing depends on memory.

Everything depends on artifacts.

---

# 9. Cache

cache/

SHA256/

audio.wav

transcript.json

...

Cache key

SHA256(video)

Cache never modifies outputs.

# 11. Provider Contract

Every provider exposes

validate()

cleanup()

No provider knows another provider.

Never mix logs.

---

# 18. Error Handling

Every stage

Retry

↓

↓

Abort

Errors never crash Electron.

---

# 19. Model Manager

Every model

Installed

Downloading

Missing

Updating

Ready

Models never auto-download.

User confirms.

---

# 20. Threading

React

Main Thread

Node

Main Thread

Workers

Separate Process

Python

Separate Process

Never block UI.

---

# 21. Performance

Avoid duplicate copies.

Stream where possible.

Reuse cache.

Enable Metal.

Avoid reading entire video into memory.

---

# 22. Security

No telemetry.

No uploads.

No external requests.

No shell injection.

Escape filenames.

Validate paths.

---

# 23. Testing

Every provider

Mockable

Every pipeline stage

Independent

Every worker

Independent

End-to-end

Entire pipeline

---

# 24. Future Extension Points

New Translator

New Voice

New Subtitle Export

New Muxer

New Model

New Plugin

No UI changes required.

---

# 25. Architecture Rules

React never calls Python.

Python never calls Electron.

Providers never know UI.

Workers never know Renderer.

Everything typed.

Everything testable.

Everything replaceable.
